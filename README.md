# elm-pitpat ([Play](https://hannover-elm.github.io/elm-pitpat/))

In one of our Hack Nights we took the [amazing
elm-pool](https://github.com/w0rm/elm-pool) and turned it into elm-pitpat, an
(apparently german) [mix of mini golf and
pool](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit-Pat)!

Many thanks to [@w0rm](https://github.com/w0rm),
[@ianmackenzie](https://github.com/ianmackenzie) and contributers for this
fantastic project and ground work. And thanks to
[@peterzilz](https://github.com/peterzilz) and
[@kirchner](https://github.com/kirchner) for this very fun Hack Night!
